## C++ First Game (LonelyKnight 2D Game)

This is my first major project, which I worked on at the end of my first year at university. I put a lot of effort into it, overcoming several challenges along the way. Thankfully, with the help of online resources, I managed to complete it on time. I'm very proud of this accomplishment.

### What I Learned

- **First C++ Game:** I learned a lot about game development, including:
  - Creating my own game engine and understanding the interactions between different components.
  - Implementing physics for character movement and collision detection.
  - Loading and managing textures, working with sprite sheets and tilemaps.
  - Loading files in XML format into my C++ game.
  - Using SDL, SDL_image, and SDL2, which was quite challenging but ultimately rewarding. This experience greatly enhanced my understanding and skills in game development.
